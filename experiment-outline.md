# Experiment on Resource Allocation in Collaborative Settings

Welcome to the Time Allocation Game!

## Objective:

As a group, you will work together to allocate your time resources to achieve the best possible outcome for the team.

### Gameplay:
Round-by-round bidding: In each round, you will bid the amount of time you want to allocate to different priorities.  There are three types of rounds which will be played during the game:

  - [ ] Silent bidding: The first few rounds will be silent bidding rounds. This will help us establish a baseline for how you typically allocate your time.
  - [ ] Discussion rounds: After the silent bidding rounds, you will have the opportunity to discuss your strategies with each other.
  - [ ] Sanctions: In some rounds, there will be joint rules enforced through sanctions. These rules will affect how you can allocate your time.

### Goal:

The goal of the game is to avoid depleting the total resource available to the team while striving for an optimal level of individual and/or team efficiency.

### Participation:

To participate in the experiment, you must be:

  - [ ] An academic working in the same area of research
  - [ ] Familiar with the work of the other participants
  - [ ] A native English speaker
  - [ ] Have received or applied for Australian Research Council (ARC) funds

### Experiment Duration:

The experiment will take approximately two hours to complete.

### Learning Objectives:

Through this experiment, we hope to gain a better understanding of how individuals make time allocation decisions in real-world collaborative settings. This information can be used to develop improved group collaboration theories and shed light on the impact of institutional variables on resource allocation dilemmas.

##  Additional Information:

 - [ ] The rules of the game will be explained at the start of each round.
 - [ ] The exact number of rounds and game variations will depend on the discussions from participants and the total time allocated to the game.

# Why play an experimental game?

## Purpose
This experiment aims to study how individuals make time allocation decisions in real-world collaborative settings. The research will explore how factors such as reciprocity, influence, reputation, trust, risk, uncertainty, motivation, bias, and policy variables affect these decisions.

## Research Questions
The research seeks to address two main questions:

 1. What behavioral patterns emerge as individuals develop better group collaboration strategies?
 2. What types of institutional variables, including physical, virtual, and policy rules, influence the likelihood of successfully resolving resource allocation dilemmas?

## Methodology
The experiment will employ a round-by-round game designed to optimize time resources and achieve an optimal team outcome. This methodology is based on the design developed by Nobel Prize winner Elinor Ostrom for analyzing optimal Common Property Resource (CPR) marketplace policies.

## Participants
The experiment will involve 5 to 7 academics working in the same research discipline. Participants should be familiar with each other's work and have received or pursued Australian Research Council (ARC) funds. Native English speakers are required due to language requirements.

## Game Mechanics
The game involves a round-by-round bidding process where participants allocate their time to different priorities under time constraints. Initially, silent bidding rounds will establish a baseline, followed by rounds with discussions to strategize or joint rules enforced through sanctions.

## Objective
The objective of the game is for the team to avoid depleting the total resource while striving for an optimal level of individual and/or team efficiency.

## Procedure
The experiment's moderator will introduce the game rules at the start of each round. The experiment will include a minimum of seven rounds, combining baseline rounds and rounds with imposed rule sets. The exact number of rounds and variations will depend on round-by-round discussions and the total time allocated for participation, which can last up to two hours.

## Expected Outcomes
The research aims to gain valuable insights into human behavior regarding time allocation in collaborative settings. The findings can inform the development of improved group collaboration theories and shed light on the impact of institutional sanctioning variables on resolving resource allocation dilemmas.
